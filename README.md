========

Organise data in a binary file based on 3D (x, z, y) ordering

Very important note:
====================
 * This is very very very pre-alpha quality code.
   At the moment it is purely a gem providing helper
   functionality to another project.

Less important note:
====================
 * There is an example of how to use this gem in
   share/test.rb
